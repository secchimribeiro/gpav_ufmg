This week, the GPAV-UFMG was confirmed as a member of the Global Virus Network (GVN). The Global Virus Network (GVN) is an international consortium of virology centers composed of leading academic and public health laboratories dedicated to the study of emerging, re-emerging, and neglected viral pathogens. It functions as a distributed scientific infrastructure that integrates basic, translational, and clinical virology to enhance global preparedness and response to viral threats. The network emphasizes genomic surveillance, viral pathogenesis, immunology, and antiviral and vaccine development across diverse geographic regions. GVN also serves as a platform for rapid data sharing, expert consultation, and evidence-based guidance to governments and global health organizations during outbreaks. A core mission of the organization is capacity building through advanced training, technology transfer, and mentorship of early-career scientists in low- and middle-income countries. Through coordinated, multidisciplinary research and policy engagement, GVN aims to mitigate the global burden of viral diseases and strengthen international biosecurity.
