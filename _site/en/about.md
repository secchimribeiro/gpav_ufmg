## Mission

Our mission is to advance the understanding of arboviral and emerging viral diseases, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and SARS-CoV-2, through the development of robust experimental models. We focus on creating and refining animal models that faithfully recapitulate human disease and immune responses. By integrating virology, immunology, and pathology, we aim to establish innovative pre-clinical platforms for translational research. Our work supports the evaluation of viral pathogenesis, host–virus interactions, and therapeutic strategies. Ultimately, we seek to accelerate the development of effective vaccines, antivirals, and intervention strategies. We are committed to scientific rigor, collaboration, and public health impact.

## Research Projects

1. **Development of Small Animal Models for Arboviral Infection**  
   This project aims to establish and characterize small animal models for dengue, Zika, and chikungunya infection. These models will be used to study disease progression, immune responses, and tissue tropism.

2. **Comparative Pathogenesis of Arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2**  
   We will investigate shared and distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis between arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in pre-clinical models. This comparative approach may reveal convergent immune pathways and therapeutic targets.

3. **Pre-clinical Platforms for Antiviral Drug Screening**  
   This project focuses on developing in vivo platforms for testing antiviral compounds against arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Efficacy, toxicity, and immunomodulatory effects will be systematically evaluated.

4. **Host Immune Determinants of Severe Arboviral Disease**  
   We aim to identify immune correlates associated with severe disease outcomes in arboviral infections using animal models. The results may inform biomarkers and targeted therapeutic strategies.

5. **Modeling Vertical and Neuroinvasive Viral Transmission**  
   This project will explore mechanisms of vertical and neuroinvasive transmission of Zika virus and other neurotropic viruses. Specialized animal models will be used to assess developmental and neurological outcomes.

6. **Vaccine Evaluation in Translational Animal Models**  
   We will develop and apply animal models to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates against arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2. These studies aim to bridge the gap between in vitro testing and clinical trials.
